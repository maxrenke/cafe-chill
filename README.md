# 🎵 Cafe Chill Downloader

A Python script that automatically downloads and combines C89.5's "Cafe Chill" show segments into a single MP3 file for offline listening.

## ✨ What It Does

This script:
- Downloads the latest "Cafe Chill" show segments from C89.5 (KNHC)

The "Cafe Chill" show has the most amazing vibes, and I wanted a way to download and enjoy these sessions offline whenever I need that perfect background music for coding, studying, or just chilling.
