# Cafe Chill

Cafe Chill is a simple batch script designed to execute a Python application with administrative privileges.

## Why I Created This
I developed this script because I love listening to [C89.5](https://www.c895.org), a fantastic station to relax and jam out to. This script makes it easy to run my project and enjoy great music simultaneously.

## Running the Script
To run the batch script, make sure you have Python installed and simply execute `cafe_chill.bat`. It will prompt you for administrative privileges and run the associated Python script.

## Acknowledgments
- Shoutout to [C89.5](https://www.c895.org) for providing amazing music to work and relax to!
