## ‚ú® What It Does

This script:
- Downloads the latest "Cafe Chill" show segments from C89.5 (KNHC)
- Automatically handles daylight saving time adjustments
- Combines multiple audio segments into one seamless MP3 file
- Adds rich metadata with appealing, day-specific titles
- Embeds album art for a complete music library experience
- Exports high-quality 192k bitrate MP3 files
- Saves the final file to your Downloads folder (or specified directory)
- Cleans up temporary files after processing

## üéß Why I Created This

I developed this script because I absolutely love listening to [C89.5](https://www.c895.org) - it's the perfect station to relax and jam out to! The "Cafe Chill" show has the most amazing vibes, and I wanted a way to download and enjoy these sessions offline whenever I need that perfect background music for coding, studying, or just chilling.
